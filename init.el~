;;; init.el --- Summary
;; All the initialisation for the configuration is done here.

;;; Commentary:
;; This file is meant to be as simple and short as possible.  Its work should be to
;; delegate work to other files that are more focused on doing their own task.
;;
;; - packages.el is for declaratively using packages and setting package-specific configs
;; - **TODO: Create config.el to write all user configurations in.**

;;; Code:

(tool-bar-mode -1) ; Disable Toolbar in GUI mode

;; Set window height and width on startup
(add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(height . 40))
(add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(width . 150))

;; prevent adding/modifying entries in package-selected-packages
;; TODO: doesn't work, fix it.
(defun package--save-selected-packages (&rest opt)
  "Do not add or modify package-selected-packages list.
whenever a package is installed or deleted; or package contents are refreshed.
